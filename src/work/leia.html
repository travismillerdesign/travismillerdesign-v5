            <p>When Leia launched their 3D lightfield display technology in 2021, <strong>no existing design patterns</strong> addressed how interfaces should behave in three-dimensional space. Depth became a new design dimension alongside color, typography, and layout. I established their <strong>foundational design system from scratch</strong>, defining how <strong>50+ designers and engineers</strong> would build for this entirely new medium.</p>

            <p>The system introduced <strong>standardized depth zones, 3D-aware components, and motion principles</strong> that would shape <strong>10+ apps and services</strong> across Leia's product ecosystem. This wasn't about adapting existing patterns—it required building <strong>scalable infrastructure</strong> for a display technology that had never existed before.</p>

            <p>I started by establishing the <strong>foundational patterns</strong> that would govern the entire system. Working within an 8pt grid informed by the tablet's resolution constraints, I defined <strong>3D depth zones</strong>—a systematic approach to layering UI elements in three-dimensional space. Each component needed precise specifications for depth placement, contrast ratios, and scale to ensure readability in <strong>lightfield viewing conditions</strong>.</p>

            <p>The color system extended Material Design's semantic variables with <strong>depth-specific adjustments</strong>. Typography established baseline grid alignment that worked across all depth planes. This technical foundation ensured every designer could build interfaces that felt cohesive, regardless of which app they were working on.</p>

            <p>Building the component library meant solving unprecedented technical challenges. I used Material Design as the foundation—since Leia's Android platform required Material conventions—but <strong>every component needed depth-specific adaptations</strong>. Buttons required higher contrast ratios than Material guidelines recommended because depth perception fundamentally changes how users perceive color relationships.</p>

            <p>I built <strong>navigation systems optimized for landscape tablet use</strong>, modular media controls with appropriate scale for 3D viewing, and extended Material's icon library with consistent construction rules. Each component included <strong>implementation guidelines</strong> that documented not just visual specs, but the technical reasoning behind depth placement and contrast decisions. This ensured engineers understood <em>why</em> components behaved differently in 3D space.</p>

            <p>The brand system refresh ran parallel to the design system work, ensuring visual consistency across both product interfaces and marketing materials. I refined logo proportions for better optical balance, created <strong>custom product wordmarks</strong> with consistent stroke weights and proportions, and consolidated the color palette using <strong>semantic variables</strong> that connected to Material Design's layering system.</p>

            <p>This wasn't cosmetic work—it was <strong>systems architecture</strong>. The brand tokens I defined became the foundation for how every designer applied color, typography, and visual hierarchy across Leia's entire product ecosystem.</p>

            <p>I redesigned the app icon family to ensure each icon clearly communicated its function while maintaining <strong>visual unity across the ecosystem</strong>. The LeiaChat icon, for example, uses a camera's profile angle to represent "video with depth"—a visual metaphor specific to 3D communication. Each icon followed consistent construction principles that reinforced Leia's brand identity while remaining functionally distinct.</p>

            <p>Building the system was only half the challenge—<strong>driving adoption</strong> required a systematic rollout strategy. I implemented the system app-by-app using a phased approach, conducting <strong>1:1 working sessions</strong> with designers to ensure they understood not just <em>what</em> to build, but <em>why</em> depth and contrast behaved differently in 3D space.</p>

            <p>I collaborated with engineering teams to establish <strong>design-code parity</strong>, ensuring our Figma components mapped directly to Android implementations. Weekly stakeholder presentations maintained alignment across product, engineering, and leadership. Within six months, the system achieved <strong>cross-functional adoption</strong>, with design-to-development time reduced by an estimated 75% as teams no longer rebuilt components from scratch.</p>
