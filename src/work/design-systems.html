    <p>PATTERNS WITHOUT PRECEDENT</p>
    <p>Design systems typically adapt existing patterns. A different approach is required 
        when technology is so new that no patterns. Systematic infrastructure that is principle 
        based rather than prescriptive, flexible enough to evolve as technology matures, and 
        strategic enough to enable teams working in ambiguous conditions.</p>

      <h2>Identifying friction points</h2>
      <p>Teams accumulate scattered assets, video footage, images and design elements, across disconnected folders. Finding specific assets manually consumes 15-20 minutes per search, compounding across dozens of daily queries.</p>
      <h2>Implementing systematic solutions</h2>
      <p>Component-based libraries enable filtering by multiple attributes simultaneously. Simple to implement, immediate impact: hours saved weekly across teams. More importantly, tangible proof that systematic approaches solve real problems, establishing credibility for larger infrastructure investments.</p>
