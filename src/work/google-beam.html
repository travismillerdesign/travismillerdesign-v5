            <h4 class="uppercase">My role</h4>
            <p>Google Beam uses AI and 3D light field display technologies to enable face-to-face conversations at natural scale. I was brought in to establish the foundational design system for this emerging technology, where every interaction pattern needed to be invented from scratch.</p>

            <h5 class="uppercase">The Challenge</h5>
            <h3>Establish design infrastructure for unprecedented technology</h3>
            <p>No existing patterns exist for designing interfaces in 3D natural scale environments. Every component, motion behavior, and spatial relationship needed to be defined, tested, and documented while the product itself was still evolving.</p>

            <h5 class="uppercase">Design System Foundation</h5>
            <h3>Creating Google's first natural scale design system for video conferencing</h3>
            <p>I built a component library from the ground up, rooted in clear design principles adapted for the unique constraints of 3D displays. The system included spatial components that use proximity to users as a tool to imply authorship, motion guidelines for immersive environments, responsive patterns for variable configurations, and a centralized asset library.</p>
            <p>The system was built on an 8pt grid to ensure consistent scale and visual rhythm, with screen real estate used deliberately and effectively.</p>

            <h3>Multiplying team impact through efficient tooling</h3>
            <p>Beyond component design, I identified opportunities to streamline workflows across the entire cross-functional team. For product managers, I created high-fidelity animations to demonstrate critical user journeys and developed reusable device frame assets. For engineering, I built comprehensive dev specs aligned with their workstreams. For researchers, I developed interactive prototypes that enabled accurate user testing of spatial interface concepts.</p>

            <h3>Testing concepts before they exist</h3>
            <p>I taught myself ProtoPie to build working prototypes that could simulate complex real-time interactions. This enabled the team to conduct meaningful user research on features that didn't yet exist in the product. I also proposed visual solutions for technical challenges, creating After Effects expression-controlled mockups and collaborating with engineering on game engine prototypes to bridge the gap between design vision and technical feasibility.</p>

            <h3>Empowering stakeholders to tell the story</h3>
            <p>Since many decisions at Google are made through slide presentations, I created specialized tools to help the team communicate effectively. This included parallax mockup templates that mimic how the product renders 3D content, original illustrations and animations for research blog posts, animated iconography for value propositions, and display graphics for demo environments.</p>

            <h3>Building systems for the unknown</h3>
            <p>Working on Google Beam reinforced that the best design systems anticipate needs before they're articulated. By creating not just components but workflows, templates, and communication tools, I helped the entire team move faster and with more confidence. The work required balancing systematic thinking with visual craft, technical prototyping with strategic planning, and flexibility with consistency.</p>
