            <h4 class="uppercase">My role</h4>
            <p>Google Beam uses AI and 3D light field display technologies to enable face-to-face conversations at natural scale. <strong>Every interaction pattern needed to be invented from scratch</strong> for this emerging technology. I established the <strong>foundational design system</strong>, defining components, spatial behaviors, and motion principles for an entirely new medium.</p>

            <h5 class="uppercase">The Challenge</h5>
            <h3>Establish design infrastructure for unprecedented technology</h3>
            <p>No existing patterns exist for designing interfaces in 3D natural scale environments. Every component, motion behavior, and spatial relationship needed to be defined, tested, and documented while the product itself was still evolving.</p>

            <h5 class="uppercase">Design System Foundation</h5>
            <h3>Creating Google's first natural scale design system for video conferencing</h3>
            <p>A <strong>component library built from the ground up</strong> became the foundation, rooted in clear design principles adapted for the unique constraints of 3D displays. Spatial components use proximity to users as a tool to imply authorship, establishing intuitive ownership patterns in shared spaces. Motion guidelines for immersive environments define how elements transition between depth planes without breaking presence.</p>
            <p>Responsive patterns accommodate variable configurations across different hardware setups, while a centralized asset library ensures consistency. The system was built on an <strong>8pt grid</strong> to ensure consistent scale and visual rhythm, with screen real estate used deliberately and effectively.</p>

            <h3>Multiplying team impact through efficient tooling</h3>
            <p>Beyond component design, opportunities emerged to streamline workflows across the <strong>entire cross-functional team</strong>. High-fidelity animations demonstrated critical user journeys for product managers, while reusable device frame assets accelerated their storytelling. <strong>Comprehensive dev specs</strong> aligned with engineering workstreams, reducing implementation friction and handoff time.</p>
            <p>For researchers, <strong>interactive prototypes</strong> enabled accurate user testing of spatial interface concepts that didn't yet exist in the product, providing crucial validation before engineering investment.</p>

            <h3>Testing concepts before they exist</h3>
            <p>Working prototypes built with <strong>ProtoPie</strong> simulated complex real-time interactions, enabling meaningful user research on features that didn't yet exist in the product. Visual solutions for technical challenges bridged the gap between design vision and feasibility.</p>
            <p>Collaboration with engineering on <strong>game engine prototypes</strong> proved that After Effects expression-controlled mockups could translate to production code, de-risking ambitious spatial interface concepts.</p>

            <h3>Empowering stakeholders to tell the story</h3>
            <p>As stakeholder presentations became critical decision points at Google, specialized communication tools emerged to help the team tell the story effectively. Parallax mockup templates mimicked how the product renders 3D content, giving leadership accurate visual references for spatial concepts.</p>
            <p>Original illustrations and animations for research blog posts articulated complex technical capabilities to broader audiences. Animated iconography distilled value propositions into memorable visual language, while display graphics transformed demo environments into compelling experience showcases.</p>

            <h3>Building systems for the unknown</h3>
            <p>Working on Google Beam reinforced that the best design systems anticipate needs before they're articulated. The work went beyond components to include workflows, templates, and communication tools that helped the <strong>entire team move faster</strong> and with more confidence.</p>
            <p>The work required balancing <strong>systematic thinking</strong> with visual craft, technical prototyping with strategic planning, and flexibility with consistency—proving that design systems for unprecedented technology demand both rigorous structure and adaptive resilience.</p>
