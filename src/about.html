    <p class="intro">I'm a design systems designer who bridges craft, code, and collaboration.</p>

    <p>
        Over 11 years, I've built design infrastructure at Apple, Google, and Leia— contributing to
        products used by millions. My background spans visual design, motion design, and technical
        implementation, which gives me a different lens on systems work than most designers in this
        space.
    </p>

    <p>
        I thrive in ambiguous, cross-functional environments where I can make both strategic
        decisions (what should the system be?) and tactical ones (how do we build and adopt it?). I
        care deeply about craft—not just functional components, but ones that feel intentional and
        delightful to use.

        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>
            I started my career in advertising in Toronto, working at agencies like Leo Burnett and
            OneMethod on brands including IKEA, Nestle, Kit Kat, and GM. I art directed campaigns,
            designed for print and digital, and created the motion graphics system for Scotiabank
            Arena (Canada's busiest arena).
