  <p class="intro">I'm a design systems designer who bridges craft, code, and collaboration.</p>
  
  <p>Over 11 years, I've built design infrastructure at Apple, Google, and Leia—
  contributing to products used by millions. My background spans visual design, 
  motion design, and technical implementation, which gives me a different lens 
  on systems work than most designers in this space.</p>
  
  <p>I thrive in ambiguous, cross-functional environments where I can make both 
  strategic decisions (what should the system be?) and tactical ones (how do 
  we build and adopt it?). I care deeply about craft—not just functional 
  components, but ones that feel intentional and delightful to use.</p>

    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p>I started my career in advertising in Toronto, working at agencies like 
    Leo Burnett and OneMethod on brands including IKEA, Nestle, Kit Kat, and 
    GM. I art directed campaigns, designed for print and digital, and created 
    the motion graphics system for Scotiabank Arena (Canada's busiest arena).</p>
